# Real-Time-Face-Mask-Detection-Using-CNN
Problem Statement:
Developed a real-time face mask detection system using TensorFlow/Keras and OpenCV. Build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify faces as either wearing a mask or not.

Description:
Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify faces as either wearing a mask or not. Achieved accurate detection of face masks in live video streams from webcam inputs. Implemented a userfriendly interface to provide real-time feedback on mask-wearing status. The system helps promote public health and safety measures by identifying individuals not wearing masks.
